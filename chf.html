            <h1>SOME FACTS ABOUT SWISS FRANCE</h1>
            <p>
                CHF is the abbreviation for the Swiss franc, which is the official currency of Switzerland. <br>
                CHF is the only franc that is still issued in Europe after the other nations, that used to denominate
                their currencies in francs, adopted the euro.<br>
                CHF's popularity stems from its status as a perennial safe-haven currency.<br>
                In the 20th century, the Swiss National Bank was required to keep 40% of its reserves in gold, but this
                requirement was eliminated in 2000.<br>
                CHF was briefly pegged to the euro between 2011 and 2015.<br>
