            <h1>Spinning top</h1>
            <p> A spinning top is a candlestick pattern that has a short real body that's vertically centered between
                long upper and lower shadows. <br>

                The real body should be small, showing little difference between the open and close prices.<br>

                Since buyers and sellers both pushed the price, but couldn't maintain it, the pattern shows indecision
                and that more sideways movement could follow.<br>

            <h1>Marubozu</h1>
            <p> A Marubozo is a long-bodied candlestick with no shadow, from the Japanese word meaning "close-cropped".
                <br>

                Candlestick charts look at the opening and closing price on a single day and are used by technical
                traders.<br>

                A candlestick with no shadows is regarded as a strong signal of conviction by either buyers or sellers,
                depending on whether the direction of the candle is up or down<br>

            <h1>DOJI</h1>
            <p> Doji are used in technical analysis to help identify securities price patterns. <br>

                A doji names a trading session in which a security has an open and close that are virtually equal, which
                resembles a candlestick on a chart.<br>

                The word doji comes from the Japanese phrase meaning “the same thing.”<br>
                A doji candlestick is a neutral indicator that provides little information. They are rare, so they
                are not reliable for spotting things like price reversals. <br>

            <h1>HAMMER</h1>
            <p> Hammer candlesticks typically occur after a price decline. They have a small real body and a long lower
                shadow. <br>

                The hammer candlestick occurs when sellers enter the market during a price decline. By the time of
                market close, buyers absorb selling pressure and push the market price near the opening price.<br>

                The close can be above or below the opening price, although the close should be near the open for the
                real body of the candlestick to remain small.<br>

            <p> A hanging man is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that occurs after a price advance. The
                advance can be small or large, but should be composed of at least a few price bars moving higher
                overall. <br>

                The candle must have a small real body and a long lower shadow that is at least twice the size as the
                real body. There is little or no upper shadow.<br>

                The close of the hanging man can be above or below open, it just needs to be near the open so the real
                body is small.<br>

            <h1>INVERTED HAMMER</h1>
            <p>The inverted hammer candlestick pattern (or inverse hammer) is a candlestick that appears on a chart
                when there is pressure from buyers to push an asset’s price up. <br>

                It often appears at the bottom of a downtrend, signalling potential bullish reversal.<br>

                The inverted hammer pattern gets its name from its shape – it looks like an upside-down hammer<br>

                body of the previous day’s candlestick. <br>

                Bullish engulfing patterns are more likely to signal reversals when they are preceded by four or more

            <p> A bearish engulfing pattern can occur anywhere, but it is more significant if it occurs after a price
                advance. This could be an uptrend or a pullback to the upside with a larger downtrend. <br>

                Ideally, both candles are of substantial size relative to the price bars around them. Two very small
                bars may create an engulfing pattern, but it is far less significant than if both candles are large.
