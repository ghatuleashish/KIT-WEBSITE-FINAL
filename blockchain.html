        <h1 class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p class="fir">
            A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a
            database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for
            their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized
            record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of
            a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party. </p>

        <p class="sec"> One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A
            blockchain
            collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain
            storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain
            of data known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into
            a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.</p>

        <p class="there"> A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies,
            structures
            its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible
            timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and
            becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the
            chain.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="work">
        <h1 class="heading"></h1>
        <p class="fir">
            The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In
            this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be
            altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology
            (DLT). </p>

        <p class="sec">First proposed as a research project in 1991, the blockchain concept predated its first
            widespread
            application in use: Bitcoin, in 2009. In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the
            creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs),
            and smart contracts.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="decentralization">
        <h1 class="heading">DECENTRALIZATION</h1>
        <p class="fir">
            Imagine that a company owns a server farm with 10,000 computers used to maintain a database holding all of
            its client’s account information. This company owns a warehouse building that contains all of these
            computers under one roof and has full control of each of these computers and all of the information
            contained within them. This, however, provides a single point of failure. What happens if the electricity at
            that location goes out? What if its Internet connection is severed? What if it burns to the ground? What if
            a bad actor erases everything with a single keystroke? In any case, the data is lost or corrupted.</p>

        <p class="sec"> What a blockchain does is to allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several network
        nodes at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the fidelity of the data
        stored therein—if somebody tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would
        not be altered and thus would prevent a bad actor from doing so. If one user tampers with Bitcoin’s record
        of transactions, all other nodes would cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the
        incorrect information. This system helps to establish an exact and transparent order of events. This way, no
        single node within the network can alter information held within it. </p>

        <p class="there">Because of this, the information and history (such as of transactions of a cryptocurrency) are irreversible.
        Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it also is possible for a
        blockchain to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a
        company’s product inventory
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="transperancy">
        <h1 class="heading">TRANSPERANCY</h1>
        <p class="fir">
            Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by
            either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring
            live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added.
            This means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes.</p>

        <p class="sec">For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost
        everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily
        traceable. If the Bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be
        known. </p>

        <p class="there">Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means
        that only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public-private key pair).
        As a result, users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="secure">
        <h1 class="heading">SECURE</h1>
        <p class="fir">
            Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks
            are always stored linearly and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of the
            blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to go back
            and alter the contents of the block unless a majority of the network has reached a consensus to do so.
            That’s because each block contains its own hash, along with the hash of the block before it, as well as the
            previously mentioned timestamp. Hash codes are created by a mathematical function that turns digital
            information into a string of numbers and letters. If that information is edited in any way, then the hash
            code changes as well.</p>

        <p class="sec"> Let’s say that a hacker, who also runs a node on a blockchain network, wants to alter a blockchain and steal
        cryptocurrency from everyone else. If they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align
        with everyone else’s copy. When everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would
        see this one copy stand out, and that hacker’s version of the chain would be cast away as illegitimate.
            <br>
        Succeeding with such a hack would require that the hacker simultaneously control and alter 51% or more of
        the copies of the blockchain so that their new copy becomes the majority copy and, thus, the agreed-upon
        chain. Such an attack would also require an immense amount of money and resources, as they would need to
        redo all of the blocks because they would now have different timestamps and hash codes. </p>

        <p class="there"> Due to the size of many cryptocurrency networks and how fast they are growing, the cost to pull off such a
        feat probably would be insurmountable. This would be not only extremely expensive but also likely fruitless.
        Doing such a thing would not go unnoticed, as network members would see such drastic alterations to the
        blockchain. The network members would then hard fork off to a new version of the chain that has not been
        affected. This would cause the attacked version of the token to plummet in value, making the attack
        ultimately pointless, as the bad actor has control of a worthless asset. The same would occur if the bad
        actor were to attack the new fork of Bitcoin. It is built this way so that taking part in the network is far
        more economically incentivized than attacking it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="used">
        <h1 class="heading">USED</h1>
        <p class="fir">
            As we now know, blocks on Bitcoin’s blockchain store data about monetary transactions. Today, there are more
            than 10,000 other cryptocurrency systems running on blockchain. But it turns out that blockchain is actually
            a reliable way of storing data about other types of transactions as well.</p>

        <p class="sec"> Some companies that have already incorporated blockchain include Walmart, Pfizer, AIG, Siemens, Unilever,
        and a host of others. For example, IBM has created its Food Trust blockchain to trace the journey that food
        products take to get to their locations.
        </p>

        <p class="there"> Why do this? The food industry has seen countless outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and listeria, as well as
        hazardous materials being accidentally introduced to foods. In the past, it has taken weeks to find the
        source of these outbreaks or the cause of sickness from what people are eating. Using blockchain gives
        brands the ability to track a food product’s route from its origin, through each stop it makes, and finally,
        its delivery. If a food is found to be contaminated, then it can be traced all the way back through each
        stop to its origin. Not only that, but these companies can also now see everything else it may have come in
        contact with, allowing the identification of the problem to occur far sooner and potentially saving lives.
        This is one example of blockchain in practice, but there are many other forms of blockchain implementation.

        <p class="fir">
            Public blockchain networks
            A public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include
            substantial computational power required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security. These
            are important considerations for enterprise use cases of blockchain.</p>

        <p class="sec"> Private blockchain networks
        A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer
        network. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to participate, execute a
        consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly boost
        trust and confidence between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and
        even be hosted on premises.</p>

        <p class="there"> Permissioned blockchain networks
        Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned blockchain network. It is
        important to note that public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. This places restrictions on who
        is allowed to participate in the network and in what transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation
        or permission to join.
            <br>
        Consortium blockchains
        Multiple organizations can share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain. These pre-selected
        organizations determine who may submit transactions or access the data. A consortium blockchain is ideal for
        business when all participants need to be permissioned and have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.
